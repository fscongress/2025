# fscongress/2025

Bills and resolutions from July 2025 onwards. Other legislation is be hosted on [another repository](https://github.com/fscongress).

The [State Legislature Board](https://trello.com/b/yXIDv41R/state-legislature-board) is the authoritative source of what laws exist, this repository is only a record of the **text** of laws. Similarly, only the [State Legislature Operations board](https://trello.com/b/Paha9q5g/state-legislature-operations) reflects bills' current progress through Congress; this repository, again, only acts as a record of the text.

The text of items may be updated to reflect floor amendments, but it might not be; these will be recorded on the Trello card for the law.

No changes can be made once the law moves to the Governor to be signed, unless procedure allows floor amendments during a veto override.

Consolidation of amendments and formatting is not of concern to this repository, but it might be of other sources such as the [Easy Access Legislation Project](https://trello.com/b/RKOOkGKX/easy-access-legislation-project)). You should consider other sources if you would prefer a more formatted experience, but should remember that other sources may not be certified as accurate.
