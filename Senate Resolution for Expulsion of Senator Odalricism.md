Whereas [Odalricism](https://www.roblox.com/users/141160063/profile) is a Senator of the State of Firestone; and

Whereas, on the 7th of December, 2025, Odalricism did commit obstruction of justice and was arrested therefor, as shown in [his record](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vjV8SihhhW9po1NoF-q8FHM4aScHYR5c/view); and

Whereas, obstruction of justice is a class A misdemeanor in the State of Firestone; and

Whereas, the commission of a misdemeanor is an act which would tend to bring the Senate of the State of Firestone and the office of Senator into disrepute, and reflects a lack of judgment by the member; and

Whereas, the Constitution of the State of Firestone vests in each chamber of Congress the power to expel its members for ineptitude, misconduct, or other plausible reason; and

Whereas, the actions of Senator Odalricism constitute gross misconduct, and demonstrate that he is not fit for office: Now, therefore,

*Be it resolved by the Senate of the State of Firestone,* that Senator Odalricism shall be expelled and removed from the Senate of the State of Firestone.
