43. The rules may not be applied ex post facto; and the Board shall not discriminate on the basis of race, nationality, gender, sex, gender reassignment, sexual orientation, or ethnicity.

**Membership**

44. Persons may only be admitted to the Bar if, in an exam administered by the Board, they demonstrate suitable knowledge of law and competence to practice as the Board may so determine.

45. The Board shall ensure that the exam is made available for taking at regular intervals, but the Board is not responsible for circumstances beyond its control which may from time to time prevent a person or class of people from attempting the exam.

46. The Board shall ensure that the content of the exam is reviewed after each exam period to generally prevent the reuse of answers from previous exam cycles with little or no additional effort from achieving a passing score.

48. All persons to be admitted to the Bar shall agree to the rules and swear an oath of honesty and integrity in connection with their exam and future practice.

49. The Board may vote to exclude a person from entry to the Bar (including attempts at the exam) on the basis, supported by a preponderance of evidence, that the person has attempted to cheat or otherwise undermine the integrity of the exam, has engaged in the unauthorized practice of law or has impersonated an attorney, or for other behavior related to the exam, legal profession, or the Bar which the Board considers most egregious; and may remove this exclusion in a further vote.

**Readminister of exam**

50. The Board may, in an ordinary vote, require a Bar member to complete the exam within a reasonable timeframe if there is probable doubt about the attorney’s competence or fitness to practice; but the Board may not require a Bar member to complete the exam if they have already passed the exam in the previous six months.

51. The Board may, in an ordinary vote, require a Bar member to complete the exam within a reasonable timeframe if, supported by a preponderance of evidence, the individual has been generally absent or inactive within the legal profession for a period of six months or longer.

52. The rules may grant the Board further powers in validating and ensuring competence of Bar members.

**Disciplinary inquiries and proceedings**

53. The Board may initiate inquiries into alleged violations of the rules in an ordinary vote; and the Board may close inquiries in a further vote.

54. The Board may vote to discipline a Bar member, up to and including expulsion from the Bar (that is, disbarment), so long as it is more likely than not that the individual contravened the rules and the disciplinary measure is proportionate with due consideration given to the circumstances and any mitigating or aggravating factors, and a person disciplined by the Board may take civil action if this is not the case.

**Prohibition on disclosure**

55. The identities of witnesses, complainants, and whistleblowers to an inquiry or potential inquiry of the Board shall remain confidential unless the individual so protected consents otherwise; and any evidence or testimony they provide to the Board, or any information provided to the Board which is subject to the attorney-client privilege, shall only be shared to the extent required to allow a Bar member to respond to an allegation and must not be distributed further except if necessary to bring or defend against a civil action, if the evidence or testimony indicates the commission of a crime or egregious ethical misconduct, or if the Board decides to authorise further distribution in an extraordinary vote.

**Attorney-client privilege**

56. There shall continue to be a right for all persons and entities to keep confidential all lawful communications and contacts relating to any legal services or prospective legal services with all legal practitioners.

57. Information protected under this right shall be subject to the attorney-client privilege and be presumed confidential, unless the information: reveals an active criminal conspiracy unrelated to the instruction or commissioning of counsel; shows a violation of (or solicitation or conspiracy to violate) the Bar rules or judicial procedures; or shows clear intent to unlawfully interfere with any legal proceedings or anything or anyone involved in a legal proceeding.

58. No person, body, or entity may compel the disclosure of or admit as evidence any information or other material subject to the attorney-client privilege; and no admission of guilt is valid (and may not be in any way considered) if the admission is made to a person providing or being petitioned to provide a legal service to the person so admitting.

59. A person receiving legal services may waive the right to the attorney-client privilege and upon doing so the right shall not apply to the portion of the contact or communication so waived; and any waiving of the right is made irreversibly but is not valid if done under any form of duress or undue influence.

60. No legal practitioner may release anything subject to the attorney-client privilege except where authorised by the client.

**Unauthorized practice of law**

61. For the purposes of this Act, the ‘Criminal Code’, as described by the [Criminal Code Revision Act (R)](https://forums.stateoffirestone.com/t/12405), shall be defined as: <https://trello.com/b/EGN3OQzQ>

62. Chapter 4, Section 27 of the Criminal Code shall be established as a Courts Only Misdemeanor A offence, entitled “Unauthorized Practice of Law”, and state:

> "(a) The unauthorized practice of law shall be recognized as an unlawful criminal offense within the State of Firestone.
> 
> (a1) The unauthorized practice of law shall be defined as knowingly creating a false impression that one is a lawyer, and whether knowingly or not:
> 
> (a1a) deriving any benefit or privilege for any person, group, or entity thereby;
> 
> (a1b) causing any injury to any person, group, or entity thereby; or
> 
> (a1c) seeking clients or any type of hire whether for legal services or not.”

**Impersonating an attorney**

63. A person not being an attorney is liable to civil action if they commit any act or omission that would cause a reasonable person to believe they are an attorney, including the use of any mark (such as esq.) that indicates Bar membership. The Board may pursue civil enforcement action in the name of the State of Firestone to effect this section. A court may order a person so found liable to remove or amend any material that induces a violation, and may enjoin that person from further violations.
