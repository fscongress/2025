*Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Firestone in Congress assembled,*

**SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE**

This Act may be cited as the "Civic Measures Act of 2025".

**SEC. 2. ENACTMENT**

This Bill shall go into effect as an Act of Congress upon the completion of the constitutionally required processes.

**SEC. 3. SEVERABILITY**

Should any part of this Act be struck down or declared unenforceable, then that part shall be considered severed with the rest remaining in full force.

**SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT**

All relevant persons shall, to the best of their ability, enforce this Act in full. Relevant persons include, but are not limited to, election sponsors and the chief executives of the State of Firestone and her devolved governments.

**SEC. 5. CIVIC MEASURE**

(a) [DonxId](https://www.roblox.com/users/77238270/profile) shall be, for genuine misconduct described herein, barred from all genuine government offices within the State of Firestone, to be defined as including Cabinet and Subcabinet, Representative and Senator, the executives and legislators of devolved governments, and the Judiciary, whether elected or appointed, but this bar shall not extend to any employment in a recognised department except where department head or deputy department head constitutes a genuine government office. The genuine misconduct for which this bar is issued includes: treason by inviting a foreign power to claim as territory the City of Redwood and to in turn direct its Police Department and to invite soldiers into it; an attempt to subvert democracy and restrain and frustrate a possible election of a successor; and the destruction of official records -- and is in the subsections herein supported by standard of clear and convincing evidence.

(b) Clear and convincing evidence in support of this measure is contained as screenshots in the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK-3IowNpLo. Genuine misconduct shown and committed includes, within his tenure as Mayor of Redwood, doing or attempting to do: (1) disestablishment of the Government of the City of Redwood, (2) sincerely (not as a joke) declaring himself Emperor of Redwood in an attempt to subvert a future, peaceful election and transfer of power; and (3) the destruction of all records he could, including stating "I see you all trying to figure out the laws in redwood, nobody is getting the trello unless I feel like giving it back" and "TO SWEDISH AND NCIS: RECOVER THESE NUTZ. YO AINT GETTING THE RW LAWS. Mfs trying to act like the heroes of Firestone. They think they're gonna get like some honorary medal" in reference to attempts made by Redwood residents to recover information destroyed by DonxId. Further evidence is contained in the following URLs: https://trello.com/c/hoeO4mBd/319-r5-31-redwood-territorial-resolution, https://i.imgur.com/3lhiLlE.png, https://i.imgur.com/ctdbOZe.png, https://i.imgur.com/Vm7DRnd.png, https://i.imgur.com/EitWP3J.png, .

(c) It is recognized that DonxId has at no point shown remorse for the misconduct committed and the harm it had on the People of Firestone.
