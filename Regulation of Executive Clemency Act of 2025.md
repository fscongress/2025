Regulation of Executive Pardons Act of 2025

</div>

<hr>

*Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Firestone in Congress assembled,*

**SEC. 1. EFFECTIVENESS**

This Act shall be effective upon completion of the constitutionally required process. However, the monthly pardon limit provisions of section 5d of this Act shall not go into effect until the 1st of November, 2025.

**SEC. 2. SEVERABILITY**

Should any part of this Act be struck down or declared unenforceable, then that part of the Act shall be considered severed from this Act, and the rest shall remain in full force.

**SEC. 3. SPECIAL LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY**

Pursuant to C.II.II(VI), Congress has the authority to establish additional guidelines on the use of the power of executive clemency and pardon from those mentioned in C.II.II(IV) that are not in conflict with the Constitution. The legislature, in this act, affirms its right alone to regulate executive clemency. Clemency shall not be restricted by judicial rules of procedure for expungement and record removal, as it is a seperate Constitutional process. 

**SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS**

For the purposes of this act–

&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) "Calendar month" means the whole time period of each of the 12 months in the Gregorian calendar. This span includes the 1st through 30th days of the months of April, June, September, and November; the 1st through 31st days of January, March, May, July, August, October, and December; and the 1st through the 28th/29th of February (depending on if it is a leap year). For the purposes of determining what exact time a new month starts of the first of any given month, UTC -5:00, US shall be used. Therefore, a new month starts on the first thereof at 12:00 AM, UTC -5:00.

&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) "Cabinet officer" shall have the same meaning as in C.II.IV(I-II)

&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) "Executing an act of clemency" shall include removing records for a pardon, releasing a person from custody for a commutation or reprieve, cancelling a non-carceral sentence for a pardon or reprieve, or dropping existing charges or prohibiting charging for a pardon.

**SEC. 5. GENERAL REGULATIONS**

(a) The Governor may not issue pardons, reprieve, or commutations in the following circumstances:

&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The recipient is the Governor themselves, the Lieutenant Governor, gubernatorial Chief of Staff, or any cabinet officer. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Furthermore, no person who has held the offices of Governor, Lieutenant Governor, gubernatorial Chief of Staff, or has held a cabinet officer position within 30 full days prior may be granted a pardon, reprieve of commutation. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Governor has been impeached and is pending or actively standing trial in the Senate. This prohibition ends when the Governor is acquitted by the Senate.

(b) Every pardon, reprieve, or commutation must be publicly announced in the Firestone Discord by the Governor themself, and include the name of the individual receiving such and the narrative requirements described within this section

(c) For every pardon, commutation, and reprieve, the Governor must state a specific rationale in a written, narrative format as to why they are issuing it to the given individual. This rationale must accompany the pardon announcement. This rationale must officiated in its document under penalty of perjury, consistent with existing statute. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) In the case of a so-called preemptive pardon for a specific criminal (or possibly criminal) act that is not on the recipient's record as an arrest/conviction/citation, the narrative must state so including what criminal acts or possibly criminal acts are being pardoned. The Governor may describe this in terms of specific statutory offenses, but this requirement is satisfied if a general description of acts is used--which shall be the bare minimum regardless.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) In regard to an existing arrest/citation/conviction or multiples thereof listing the specific record alone is sufficient to meet the requirement. The narrative of why the pardon, reprieve, or commutation is being issued must still be given consistent with this act, however. 

(d) The Governor may only issue five acts of executive clemency total per calendar month (that is, a combination of pardons, reprieves, and commutations not to exceed a total of five. I.e. the Governor may issue 5 pardons and no other acts of clemency; or two pardons, two commutations, and a reprieve; etc.).

&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The five acts of clemency per month do not carry over to the next month if less than five have been used. I.e., if the Governor pardons three people in June, he still may only pardon, reprieve or commute five people in July.

(e) Only the sitting Governor may exercise executive clemency. The Lieutenant Governor acting in the capacity of Acting Governor under C.II.V(III) shall not have the power of executive clemency. 

**SEC. 6 CLEMENCY ISSUED IN CONTRAVENTION OF THIS ACT**

(a) Any pardon, reprieve, or commutation issued in violation of the provisions herein shall be void at face. 

(b) Intent or knowledge of a violation shall not be required to demonstrate the invalidity of a pardon, reprieve, or commutation issued in violation of this act. 

(c) The Governor, or any person acting on their behest, may not execute an act of clemency in violation of this act. Doing so shall be grounds for impeachment. 

(d) Chapter 6, §23(a4) of the Firestone Criminal Code does not exist, but shall be created and state: "(a4) Knowingly executing clemency in violation of the provisions of the Regulation of Executive Clemency Act of 2025 shall also be Mishandling of Government Information."
