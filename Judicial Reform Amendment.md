This Joint Resolution may be known as the "Judicial Reform Amendment".

**SEC. 2. EFFECTIVENESS**

This Joint Resolution shall be effective upon completion of the constitutionally required process.

**SEC. 3. SEVERABILITY**

Should any part of this Joint Resolution be struck down or declared unenforceable, then that part of the Joint Resolution shall be considered severed from this Joint Resolution, and the rest shall remain in full force.

**SEC. 4. AMENDMENT**

(a) Article III, section I of the Constitution shall be amended by inserting after clause IV—

"V. All matters before a court of the State of Firestone must originate from an outside party.
"VI. The courts of the State of Firestone shall maintain the power of judicial review."

(b) Article III, section II of the Constitution shall be amended by striking the current text and inserting the following—

"I. The Supreme Court of Firestone shall be the highest court in the land and guardian of the Constitution. It shall maintain original jurisdiction in matters involving the extraordinary writs described in this section. It shall maintain appellate jurisdiction in all other matters, except that the Supreme Court may adjudge a question of law certified to it by the District Court, under such procedures as it may prescribe.
"II. The Supreme Court of Firestone shall be composed of a Chief Court Justice and a maximum of four Associate Justices.
"III. The Supreme Court of Firestone shall have the authority to issue writs of certiorari, and the extraordinary writs of mandamus, habeas corpus, and quo warranto. Petitions for a matter invoking the Court’s original jurisdiction shall be done through a motion for leave of appellate jurisdiction.
"IV. The Supreme Court of Firestone shall maintain the power to create rules of procedure for all matters before the State Courts. These rules, and any changes to them, must be approved by a majority vote of both houses of Congress.
"V. In instances in which the District Court has half or less of the maximum number of judges seated, the Chief Justice and any Associate Justices may ride the District Court as trial judges, though they shall be required to recuse themselves in appeals of cases they try. A justice may continue to preside over a District case taken during a period in which half or less of the District Court seats were filled even if new judges are appointed to push past that limit.
"VI. All actions of the Supreme Court of Firestone shall require a majority vote of its members excluding recused members."
