*Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Firestone in Congress assembled,*

**SECTION 1.**

This bill may be known as the “More Amendments to the Inferior Governments Act”.

**SEC. 2.**

(a) Section 8 of the Inferior Governments Act currently states:

"(a) Stapleton County shall obtain a government, which shall be led by the County Executive.
Only one (1) individual may hold the office of County Executive at a time, and it shall be
only an elected position.

(b) An election, hosted by the Governor, either through position vacancy (special election) or
on the basis of every four (4) months shall be required in order to seat a County
Executive.

(c) The County Executive may be removed from office by impeachment of the House of
Representatives and conviction of the Senate. Stapleton County shall have the ability to
establish law or legislation permitting the removal of the County Executive, such as
impeachment or expulsion.

(d) No person may run for County Executive after having served four (4) full terms.

(i) If an individual is specially elected into the office of County Executive with less than thirty-one (31) remaining in their term, such shall not be rendered as a full term. This threshold may be shortened, but not lengthened, by a relevant county charter.

**SEC. 3.**

(a) Section 8 of the Inferior Governments Act shall be amended to state:

(a) Stapleton County shall obtain a government, which shall be led by the County Executive. Only one (1) individual may hold the office of County Executive at a time, and it shall be only an elected position.

(b) An election, hosted by the Governor, either through position vacancy (special election) or on the basis of every four (4) months shall be required in order to seat a County Executive.

(c) The County Executive may be removed from office by impeachment of the House of Representatives and conviction of the Senate. Stapleton County shall have the ability to establish law or legislation permitting the removal of the County Executive, such as impeachment or expulsion.

(d) If an individual is specially elected into the office of County Executive with less than thirty-one (31) days remaining in the term, such shall not be rendered as a full term. This threshold may be shortened, but not lengthened, by a relevant county charter.

(e) The County Council shall have the authority, through legislation, to establish a lawful line of succession for the Office of the County Executive in the event of vacancy, incapacitation, removal, or any circumstance where the County Executive is unable to execute the duties of the office.

**SEC. 4.**

This Act shall be effective upon completion of the constitutionally required process.

**SEC. 5.**

Should any part of this Act be struck down or declared unenforceable, then that part of the Act shall be considered severed from this Act, and the rest shall remain in full force.
