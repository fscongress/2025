"II. For a recall petition to trigger a recall referendum, the following requirements must be met within 14 days of the recall petition being posted: the recall petition has attained a total of 50 signatures from citizens; the recall petition has attained a total of 3 signatures from state government officials, excluding the Lieutenant Governor and the Governor, these individuals may still sign personally but it will not count towards this additional requirement. If a recall petition does not meet these requirements within 14 days of posting, it shall be considered failed. Judges or justices may not sign or publish a recall petition, but may vote on recall referendums if ordinarily capable (i.e. not banned from the Firestone Forums).

"III. Upon a recall petition passing and a recall referendum being triggered, the Governor (or in either absence or incapacity, the Lieutenant Governor) shall, at least three days but no longer than five days subsequent to the referendum being triggered, publish and advertise a poll on the official Firestone Forums, linking to the recall petition, and specifically asking if the member named is to be recalled from their congressional office.

All votes must be cast through the official Firestone Forums and this vote will be considered an official election; the rigging or manipulation of such shall be a felony, as shall the act of threatening, bribing, or criminally intimidating any individual for the purposes of voting in a particular way. The Governor shall be prohibited to manually close the referendum unless they are removing the posting in favour of a newer posting (which will be considered a new referendum) for technical reasons or if the automatic closing mechanism has failed to operate correctly.

"IV. Upon the conclusion of a recall referendum, if the vote is at least 70% in favour of recall and there have been a minimum of 60 voters, the named member shall be immediately removed from office and be ineligible to run for or hold congressional office for a fixed 21 day period.

“V. The same citizen may not create two recall petitions within 30 days. No member of congress may have more than one open (i.e. not failed or triggered) recall petition towards them. No member of congress may have a recall petition made against them if there is a pending or ongoing recall referendum against that member. Whereas a recall petition or referendum has failed, that same member may not be subject to an additional recall petition made against them for 14 days. A recall petition may not be created if a member is within their first 15 days of holding office. A recall petition may not be created against a member if articles of impeachment, conviction by senate, or expulsion against said member has failed within the past 14 days or was proposed (and has not yet been voted on) within the past 5 days.”
