## **A BILL**

**To provide for the continuity of elections.**

<!-- </div> -->

---

*Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Firestone in Congress assembled,*

**SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE**

This Act may be cited as the "Elections Continuity Act".

**SEC. 2. ENACTMENT**

This Bill shall go into effect as an Act of Congress upon the completion of the constitutionally required processes.

**SEC. 3. SEVERABILITY**

Should any part of this Act be struck down or declared unenforceable, then that part shall be considered severed with the rest remaining in full force.

**SEC. 4. AMENDMENT**

(a) In section 3(f) of the Elections Act, substitute "an alternate system" with "a successor platform".

(a) Create section 1Z of the Elections Act, which shall state:

> "Any reference to the Founder includes a reference to a successor owner of Firestone, and the Founder may delegate any of his duties or powers."

and that shall also extend to any interpretations of this Act.

**SEC. 5. ALTERNATE ELECTIONS**

(a) For the purposes of section 3(f) of [the Elections Act](https://trello.com/c/VDpe7Clr/3380-the-elections-act), an election sponsor may designate any alternate system or place for speeches and canvassing to take place.

(b) For the purposes of section 3(f) of the Elections Act, the Governor may with the consent of the Chief Justice and Speaker of the House (though the Speaker of the House's consent may be substituted by that of both the President pro tempore and two Associate Justices not including the Chief Justice) authorize an alternate voting platform, so long as the platform fulfils requirements of both security and secrecy, non-citizens must not be able to vote using an alternate platform, the voting methods prescribed by the Elections Act (i.e. the plurality voting system) must be preserved, and any other requirements of the Elections Act not aforementioned can be met by the alternate platform.

(b) Elections shall be postponed if the Firestone Forums is not available or stable, there is no successor platform, and no alternate platform can be designated. The terms of officeholders are not extended in such an instance.

(c) This section, and the powers it confers, only applies if the Firestone Forums are not available or not stable and no successor platform has been provided by the Founder in accordance with section 3(f) of the Elections Act.

(d) If owing to a fault or defect with election platforms, an election is not started in time for the minimum timelines to be met in accordance with the Elections Act (and so on the Constitution specified term end date, no new office holders are certified) then section 3(c) of the Elections Act does not apply and the election sponsor may reduce timelines of the speeches and voting phases (but not to less than 48 hours per phase) at his or her discretion to best meet the Constitution specified term end date.

**SEC. 6. ALTERNATE SPONSOR**

(a) If the Founder fails to sponsor Gubernatorial Elections and fails to designate a sponsor, the Chief Justice may assume the role of sponsor; but any decision on the eligibility or disqualification of any candidate must be ratified by either the Speaker of the House or two Associate Justices not including the Chief Justice, and is reviewable by the council established by section 9(e) of the Elections Act.

(b) Should subsection (a) be invoked, the voting platform used shall be the same as for congressional elections (whether that is the Firestone Forums, a successor platform, or an alternate platform under section 5); and any ties shall be settled as if it were a House of Representatives election with only one vacancy.
